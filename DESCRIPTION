Title: Two Group Straight Line ANCOVA
Description: This package computes four models associated with the two-group,
    straight line ANCOVA (ANalysis of COVAriance) problem: (A) full model, which
    fits two intercepts and two slopes; (B) a completely reduced model, which
    fits a single intercept and single slope to all the data; (C) a reduced
    model, which fits two separate intercepts and a single, common slope to the
    data; and (D) a reduced model, which fits a single, common intercept and two
    separate slopes to all the data.
