## sla - R Package

This package considers the simplest case of ANCOVA, the two-group, straight-line case. We have two groups (a factor variable) and a single regressor (x, numeric) against a single criterion variable (y, numeric).

TODO:

- nice to have: move documentation to roxygen
- work on table justification in vignette
- add modelType2Plot = "all" option
